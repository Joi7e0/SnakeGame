## Objective

The objective of the Snake game is to control a snake and make it eat as much food as possible. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the player's score increases. The challenge of the game is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. As the snake grows, maneuvering becomes more difficult, making it essential to plan movements carefully to avoid crashes.

## Gameplay

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move the snake up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move the snake down
  - **Left Arrow**: Move the snake left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move the snake right

- **Objective**: Navigate the snake to eat food that appears on the screen. Each piece of food consumed increases the snake's length and adds to the score.

- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself. 

- **Scoring**: Your score increases with each piece of food the snake eats. Try to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.
