## Objective

The objective of the Snake game is to encourage the snake to eat as much food as possible to grow larger while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. Each piece of food consumed increases the player's score and the snake's length, making the game progressively more challenging. Try to score as many points as possible before the snake crashes!
