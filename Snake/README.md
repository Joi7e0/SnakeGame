## Objective

The goal of the Snake game is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible to grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. Each piece of food eaten increases the player's score and the length of the snake, making the game progressively more challenging. Try to achieve the highest score possible before the snake crashes!
